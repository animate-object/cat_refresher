## Cat Refresher
##### A refreshing application for refreshing cats

This is a little project to refresh my memory and play around with elm again.

Not sure what the end state is, but here are some things I'd like to implement:

- [x] click on previous URL to bring image up again
- [ ] incorporate elm/css and improve styling
- [ ] allow saving 'favorites' to local storage
- [ ] explore routing with separate pages for
    * cat viewer
    * image history
    * favorites
- [ ] embed this in my personal site
